# BbStats
BbStats reports data on LMS tool adoption.  It also tracks concurrent sessions on the system at the database level for all application servers. It provides user reports by activity levels.  Settings allow for selecting the date range for graphs, limiting access. The interface is compatible with mobile devices like the iPhone.  Overall CPU and Memory resource graphs are in planning to provide usage context.
